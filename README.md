Project Name:

In Five

Description:

A multiple choice mathmatical quiz in which you have five seconds to answer each question, everytime you get a question right within five seconds the countdown restarts at 5.

Technologies used:

Vanilla Javascript

jQuery

Adobe; Illustrator, photoshop and flash


Approach Taken:

Created a countdown timer and randomly generated addition or multiplication questions with the wrong multiple choice answers within a reasonable range of the correct answer.

Created a stopwatch in adobe flash and exported it as an MP4 file before syncing it with the javascript countdown timer. Every time you got an answer right within 5 seconds it restarted.

Implemented code to increase the difficulty of the game after every five answers you get right.

Replaced the MP4 file with a far higher quality swiffy.


Unsolved Problems:

Allowing the swiffy to start paused and then to play and restart at will.


What I would add:

Divisions.

Lengthen the animation to include a bad luck message when the player gets the answer wrong.
